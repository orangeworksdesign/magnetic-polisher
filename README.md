# magnetic-polisher
Arduino code for a motor-driven magnetic polisher

Designed for the Arduino Uno, it barely fits on an ATMega328.  It uses a 2.8" touch screen LCD (I got mine from Adafruit https://www.adafruit.com/product/1947) two momentary pushbuttons (https://www.adafruit.com/?q=rugged%20metal%20pushbutton%20momentary) and a rotary encoder (https://www.adafruit.com/product/377) - plus, of course, a Clearpath servo motor (https://www.teknic.com/model-info/CPM-MCVC-3441D-RLN/) and a 75 volt power supply (https://www.teknic.com/products/servo-motor-dc-power-supply/)
